          <br>
          <p>I'm a Software Engineer from the UK, with over half a decade's experience in developing tooling and games
            for the Roblox platform!</p>
          <br />
          <p>I have been a member of the Roblox Platform since January 2017, where I started developing games on the
            platform in December of the same year</p>
          <br>
          <p>I believe I have a vocation for game development and aspire for it to be a full-time career, with computers
            taking up a good portion of my childhood.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I've mostly worked as a solo programmer on my projects, however I have worked in teams previously and am
            open to working in teams.</p>
          <br>
          I understand the industry standards, so you can get your projects delivered at the
          <purple-underlined-p>absolute best quality.</purple-underlined-p>

        This game was a project with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Meknor">Meknor</a> and another developer named Barj.

        <br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately, the game was discontinued due to Meknor's burnout and <br>
        I was removed from the dev team due to my age at the time, which was only <br>
        discussed after I had done some work.

      <h5 class="heading-purple">June 2024 - Current</h5>
      <p>Playverse Studio is a Roblox game studio with over 1 BILLION total visits.</p>
      <p>I have worked on many projects, however none have been released yet due to unforseen circumstances.</p>
      <p>My largest project was one named "Presidents!", a rap-battle styled game which involved two candidates arguing
        for who would be the best president.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we planned this project around the launch of the Presidential Election in the US, and we missed
        our deadline - we also had problems with some of the features not working how we really wanted. This caused us
        to scrap the game and move on.</p>
      <p>The Gallery below will show some screenshots and code snippets from "Presidents"</p>

        This website was made by me to replace my old website. I'm by no means a web developer however I do want to put
        this here
        to show what I made myself.
        <br>
        <br>
        This site was originally from a template by Akash Bhadange, which I have modified a hell of a lot to get the
        current results.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h3>What I made myself: </h3>
      <br>
      I made the popup boxes which appear when you press "know more"
      <br>
      (The box you are reading this in now!)
      <br>
      I also made the entire gallery myself, which took a lot of trial and error but I had fun!
      <br>
      <br>
      There is no gallery, as you are on the site right now. The code is also
      <a href="https://github.com/isophes/new-site">open source on github.</a>

      <p>Strongest Punch Ever is a small project that I worked on in collaboration with Morl Studios. It is a
        simple game about punching and lifting weights to get more money and rebirthing. </p>
      <br />
      <p>I learnt a lot from this game, such as balancing economys and updating a game under deadlines. We have a 96%
        L/D Ratio with a Max CCU of approximately 300, nearly 50,000 favourites and over 450,000 visits! Below you can
        find a link to the game: </p>

      <br />
      <p>Unfortunately, our ideas were

      <p>Team Hydrogem is my own development studio.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Team Hydrogen is currently specialising in open source software, developing frameworks such as: </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/teamhydrogen/hydrogen">- Hydrogen</a>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>and other unreleased things. We are currently working
        on our website - made in pure html, css and Javascript (and is currently killing me as of writing in October
        2025), which can be found
        <a href="https://teamhydrogen.pages.dev">here.</a>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Team Hydrogen's motto is "Think Different", highlighting how we want to be unique in the space and not repeat
        the same things constantly, like other companies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>We also follow the principle of quality over quantity, where we would rather make one high-quality game than
        many low effort brainrot games. Ethics and morals are important and shouldn't be overlooked in a business.
        That's how things go wrong.</p>
